# KNN-Classification

A simple implementation of K Nearest Neighbors classifier model in python. The classifier object is created using the KNeighborClassifier class which was imported from sklearn.neighbors.

The parameters passed into the KNeighborsClassifier include:

n_neighbors = 5. This is the default value of the n_neighbors argument. Increasing the value of n_neighbors increases the value of K. For example, if n_neighbors is given a value of 5, the number of neighbors taken for comparing the value of the new data point will be 5.

metric = 'minkowski'. This metric uses Euclidean metric.

p = 2. This is the power parameter. The value 2 is given for Eculidean distance.

A confusion martrix is later created to determine the accuracy of the model


Its very useful repo to learn how to implemnet KNN Algorithem in machine learning practically.

I define evaerthing by comment in Python source-code.

I used Library in this project like Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
